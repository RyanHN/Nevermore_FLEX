# Nevermore_FLEX
Easy-to-install Solder fume extractor, that can double as a 3D printer recirculation filter. 
All parts 3D-printable, just needs a GPU fan, a PWM controller and a 12v power source/DC connector!
Optional 12v LED-lighting and/or 80mm axial intake fan, using magnetic power connectors.
